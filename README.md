<h1 align="center"> Studying Apple's native translator </h1>
This repository is a case study that has the main goal of learning about programming by replicating a native Apple app, following the HIG guidelines.

    During the development process, the SwiftUI framework was used to create the interface of the native Apple application. The developer leveraged the capabilities of SwiftUI, a powerful tool that allows for quick and intuitive user interface creation. With the use of SwiftUI, the necessary design changes were implemented to comply with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable user experience. The simplicity and flexibility offered by SwiftUI facilitated the creation of an elegant and responsive interface, making the development process more efficient and effective.

    Additionally, the development team integrated the Google Translation API into the application. This integration enabled users to enjoy advanced translation features within the app. By consuming the Google Translation API, the developers were able to implement translation functionality efficiently and reliably. The Google Translation API offers comprehensive features such as text translation in multiple languages, automatic language detection, and the ability to translate large volumes of text. With this integration, app users experienced a seamless and accurate translation experience, adding value to the application and expanding its utility to a broader audience.
